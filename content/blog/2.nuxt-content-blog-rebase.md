# Rebase

## The basics of git rebase

### How to start a rebase

You can define an alias to print the git log in a friendlier way.

From there you can see each commit hash.

To start the rebase procedure we need to do `git rebase -i <HASH>` where `<HASH>` is the hash of an ***ancestor*** of all the commits we want to modify.

**TIPS:** if like me you always copy and paste the hash of the commit you want to modify instead of its parent, you can append `^1` to the commit hash, like so `git rebase -i <HASH>^1` `. This will include our commit in the rebase.

This is the starting point

and those are the commands we can use instead of `pick`

### What can we do?

#### fix a commit with `fixup`

#### delete a commit `drop`

#### modify a commit with `edit`
