## Intro to nuxt content

### Getting the starter code

`npx nuxi init content-app -t content`

`cd content-app && npm install`

`npm run dev`

This will have created three pages for us:

- one for the route `/`
- one for the route `/about`
- one for the "template" of the pages `[...slug].vue`

This is the the default file structure we start with.

We can see in the `[...slug].vue` file something called `<ContentDoc />`

The two other files are just markdown.

### Add a page to my blog

To add a page just add a new markdown file in the `/content` folder.

To create a link to a page, just reference the relative position of the markdown file inside the `/content` folder.

⚠When modifying the page, sometimes the Hot Module Reload breaks and you might need to restart the dev server to make the error go away.

## Organize your content

Nuxt Content comes with several "quality of life" for content management.

1. ✨ Ordering of the content.
2. Ability to ignore the content, so you can actually put everything where you want it to be
3. Ability to create and reuse partial content.

### How markdown is rendered to component in Nuxt Content

Every line in your markdown will be translated to a Vue3 component.

On this page you can see every Prose component : https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/components/prose/

#### We're going to try to customize the `<h1>` Prose component

We're going to follow the official recipe:

1. we got it : https://github.com/nuxt/content/blob/main/src/runtime/components/Prose/ProseH1.vue

it's working

## Into to document driven mode

# To deploy to firebase

```
cd <votre-app-content>
npx nuxi generate
firebase init 
# choose hosting and for the public dir .output/public
# choose to rewrite URL to index.html


```

# How to deal with images

1. find a way to automatically upload them and replace them by a link (typora etc...)

OR 

1. create a `public/img` directory at the root of your content app
2. put your image `myImageName.png`in that folder
3. In your markdown `[alt img title](/img/myImageName.png)`

or you may use the assets directory

# How to style 

## You can use a Nuxt Content Theme

https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind

`npx nuxi@latest init -t themes/content-wind my-website`

`cd my-website && npm install`

`npm run dev`

## You can use a classless CSS 

Pick a theme here https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css then install it however you want.

Personally I just copy and paste the css into a global script tag in a vue App.
